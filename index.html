        <h3>Life is better with dogs</h3>

        <p>Nothing beats a long walk with your four-legged friend on a fresh, spring morning. Or seeing the joy on their faces when you pick up a ball and they know it’s playtime in the local park! Even relaxing at home feels better in each other’s company.</p>

        <p>There’s an old saying, which is certainly true, that dogs repay the love you give them ten-fold. Before you rush out and adopt a dog, it’s important to think it through very thoroughly. Caring for a dog can be hard work and it’s a lifetime commitment, as your dog will be relying on you for many years to come. Once you’re sure you have the time and lifestyle to include a dog in your life, and you’ve done your research about different dog breeds and personalities it’s time to look at all the benefits of owning a dog.</p>
